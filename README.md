# aquacomputer_quadro-hwmon
*A hwmon Linux kernel driver for exposing sensors of the Aquacomputer Quadro fan controller.*

Supports reading temperatures and speed, power, voltage and current of the attached fans and speed of a flowmeter. Being a standard `hwmon` driver, it provides readings via `sysfs`, which are easily accessible through `lm-sensors` as usual:
